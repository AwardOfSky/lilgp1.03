On a this note, I wanted to see how to profile the gcc program.  Do the following.
The example I useed is in app/orig_no_adf/orig_gerules_1
Modify GNUMakefile to be debug with -g option
Modify GNUMakefile in ../../../kernel.<whatever>/GNUMakefile and put -pg as last option on CC line, including TARGET
This will produce a gmon.out file.
Then type:
  gprof ./gp gmon.out > profile.out

The results will be in profile.out.  Right now the program is 100% recursive.....  Look into gpcpu speedup.
