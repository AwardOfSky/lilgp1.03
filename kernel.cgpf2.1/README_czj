cgp-lil-gp 2.1.1/1.02 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
by. c.z.janikow & s.deweese

  Major changes vs. 1.02 (2.0 was never publicly released)
    a) constraints
       - interactive input has been slightly changed (makes constraint 
         specification option, using default unconstrained case)
       - constraints can be specified in a file using a friendly language
         (added by Scott Deweese)
    b) weights
       - constraints can be weighted (can be entered interactively or
         in the same constraint file)
    c) overloaded functions
       - a 'generic' type can be used (as implicit in version 1.02)
       - types can be explicitly listed, and functions can be overloaded
         for different types
    d) extra parameters
       - a few additional parameters to better control initialization/
         mutation/crossover 
    e) new operators
       - collapse, as crossover, but on a single individual
       - uniform_mutate, implements the uniform_mutation operator
    f) resets index members for fset functions (changes lilgp) plus
         sorting method was changed (changes lilgp)
    g) crossover is reimplemented so that source trees are selected based 
       on mutation set weights and the internal/external parameter

    Change from cgp2.1:
       initialization and mutation/uniform mutation modified to 
       never generate trees (if possible due to constraints) shorher than the
       min depth ramp (NOTE: only if the corresponding parameter depth_abs
       is set to true

cgp-lilgp is implemented in lil-gp
(http://isl.cps.msu.edu/GA/software/lil-gp/). cgp-lilgp2.1/1.02 is based
on lil-gp1.02. 
cgp-lilgp is provided as a replacement kernel for that of lil-gp.
