- road to this version.
  1) changed pop_stats variables in lilgp1.02 from int to long, integer overflow problems
  2) added adfs, to cgp2.1 (it did not adfs) forming cgpf2.1
  3) used cgpf2.1 and folded in acgp1.1.2 code forming acgpf2.1 framework
  4) added generation ramp feature in gp.c.  See dissertation in doc folder
  5) made use of gnu libsan to make sure no memory problems appear
